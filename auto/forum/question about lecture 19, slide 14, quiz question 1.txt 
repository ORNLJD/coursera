During the explanation of slide 14, Dr. Ulman says that "if w is accepted by M then M_L is run on input x". So if M doesn't halt on w, then the entire algorithm (M') doesn't halt because M_L is never run and can neither accept nor reject x. Yet the accepted quiz question answer says that "If M does not halt on w then (M, w) is not in L_u. M' accepts Null, and L(M') does not have the property P." But I don't understand how M' can ever accept Null if it is running continuously on w without halting: How does M' know when to stop waiting for M to halt on w in order to return False ("no") to decide the problem?
