Notes

Examples of Undecidable questions about programs or Turing machines, M, (since programs can simulate any Turing Machine) and their languages, L:

* Is L(M) a regular language?
* Is L(M) context-free?
* Does L(M) include any palindromes?
* I L(M) empty?
* Does L(M) contain more than N strings? (for any N)

Undecidable problems that don't involve Turing machines

* Is a particular CFG ambiguous?
# Is a given CFL equal to all possible strings over its terminal alphabet?
* Is a particular CFL a regular langage?

Lecture 19, slide 21, refers to list of indexes i1,...ik and then uses the indexes calling them i1, ... in (w_i1...w_in = xi1...xin)
